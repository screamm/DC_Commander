## Vision Statement

Transform DC Commander from a functional Norton Commander clone into a production-ready, high-performance, cross-platform file manager with excellent security, accessibility, and user experience.

---

## Current State Assessment

### Strengths âœ…
- Clean layered architecture
- Good design pattern usage (Command, Strategy)
- Excellent security module (not yet integrated)
- Authentic Norton Commander UI/UX
- Solid Textual framework integration

### Weaknesses ðŸ”´
- Synchronous I/O blocks UI
- Security module not used
- Test coverage only ~35%
- No platform-specific handling
- Missing progress indicators
- Type hints incomplete (60%)

### Technical Debt Score

**Total: ~6-8 weeks of effort**
- Critical: 2-3 weeks (async operations, security integration, documentation)
- High: 2-3 weeks (type hints, testing, CI/CD)
- Medium: 1-2 weeks (performance, refactoring, platform adapters)
- Low: 1 week (UI enhancements, minor cleanups)

- [ ] Add lazy loading for large directories
- [ ] Optimize string operations (pre-compute constants)
- [ ] Profile and measure all improvements
- [ ] Add performance tests

**Implementations:**

**Directory Caching:**
```python

            return self._dir_cache[cache_key]

        items = self._scan_directory()
        self._dir_cache[cache_key] = items
        return items
```

**Lazy Loading:**
```python
def _load_directory_lazy(self, chunk_size=100):
    """Load directory contents in chunks for better responsiveness"""
    items = []
    for i, entry in enumerate(self.current_path.iterdir()):
        items.append(FileItem.from_path(entry))
        if i % chunk_size == 0 and i > 0:
            yield items  # Yield to UI for update

) -> OperationSummary:
    """Common logic for file operations (copy, move, delete)"""
    success_count = 0
    error_count = 0
    errors = []

    for item in items:
        try:
            dest_file = dest_path / item.name
            operation(item, dest_file)
            success_count += 1
        except Exception as e:
            errors.append((item.name, str(e)))
            error_count += 1

    return OperationSummary(
        self._determine_result(success_count, error_count),
        success_count,
        error_count,
        errors

        super().__init__()
        self.title = title
        self.total = total
        self.current = 0
        self.canceled = False
        self.cancelable = cancelable

    def update(self, current: int, message: str = ""):
        self.current = current
        percent = (current / self.total) * 100
        self.query_one(".progress-bar").update(percent)
        self.query_one(".progress-message").update(message)

    def on_key(self, event):
